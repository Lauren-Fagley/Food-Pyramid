# Food Pyramid Website

This project is a simple interactive food pyramid built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to visually track servings across different food categories by incrementing or decrementing values in each zone of the pyramid.
Overview

The pyramid consists of six stacked zones, each representing a different category in the food pyramid. Users can adjust the count of each category using "+" and "–" buttons. The interface is fully client-side and styled with custom CSS shapes and colors.
Features

- Interactive controls for each pyramid zone (increment/decrement).

- Dynamic updating of serving counts.

- Visually styled pyramid using CSS clip-path for custom shapes.

- Responsive design structure using flexbox.

- Simple user input for date entry (not functionally processed in this version).

# File Structure

assignment-01.html — Main HTML structure of the web page.

assignment-01.css — Contains all the styles, including zone shapes, hover effects, and layout.

assignment-01.js — JavaScript logic for updating zone values and handling button events.

# How to Run

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open the assignment-01.html file in any modern web browser.

Interact with the pyramid by hovering over each zone and using the "+" and "–" buttons.

# Notes on Functionality

The food count values are stored in an array in memory and are not persistent between page reloads.

JavaScript is required for interactive functionality.

Input field for date currently serves only as a placeholder and is not connected to any functionality.

# Possible Improvements

Add labels or tooltips to each pyramid zone to indicate which food group it represents.

Store user input and food counts using local storage or a backend.
